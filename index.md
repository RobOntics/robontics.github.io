International Workshop on Ontologies for Autonomous Robotics (ROBONTICS) @ [AIxRobotics](http://https://www.aixrobotics.org/), Naples, Italy (hybrid event -- online participation also possible)

We encourage researchers interested in the fields of robotics and knowledge engineering to submit research and position papers by *October 15th*.
Researchers with accepted papers will be invited to present at the RobOntics 2025 workshop.

**WORKSHOP MOTIVATION**

RobOntics focuses on autonomous agents informed by knowledge-driven approaches, with particular
emphasis on formal systems like ontologies, knowledge graphs, and their integration with neural
architectures. The workshop aims to foster interaction across robotics, ontology, knowledge
representation and reasoning, and neural computing to investigate promising cognitively-inspired
knowledge based architectures, neuro-symbolic approaches and review progress in knowledge-driven
robotics.

Today, the convergence of symbolic knowledge representation and neural learning is reshaping
robotics and standardization efforts for intelligent robotic systems. Many open problems involve
autonomous agents that must seamlessly integrate symbolic reasoning with neural perception and
learning while operating in natural, artificial, or socio-technical environments. Research projects in
healthcare assistance, logistics, autonomous driving, and human-robot collaboration increasingly
require robots that can both learn from experience and reason with explicit knowledge in realistic
human environments.

One of the key challenges is developing cognitive-inspired architectures that combine the flexibility of
neural learning with the interpretability and structure of symbolic knowledge. Robotic agents need
reactive world models that can rapidly adapt to dynamic environments while maintaining coherent
knowledge representations. Further, knowledge-driven and commonsense knowledge-driven
interaction capabilities must enable robots to understand, predict, and respond to human intentions and
behaviors in natural, contextually-appropriate ways. Such knowledge should be reusable across
different agents and scenarios while remaining accessible and modifiable by human operators.

To garner trust, ensure dependability, and enable effective human-robot collaboration, hybrid
intelligence systems must provide transparent explanations of their reasoning processes and offer
intuitive interfaces for knowledge inspection and modification.

**Special Topic of RobOntics 2025**

This edition of RobOntics is particularly interested in three interconnected themes:

*Neuro-symbolic architectures for autonomous agents*: Exploring architectures that integrate neural
networks with symbolic reasoning systems, enabling robots to learn from data while maintaining
interpretable knowledge structures and logical reasoning capabilities.

*Cognitive-inspired world models for knowledge-driven reactive agents*: Investigating how
cognitive principles can inform the development of dynamic world models that support rapid,
knowledge-informed reactions to environmental changes while maintaining consistency with learned
and encoded knowledge.

*Knowledge-driven human-robot interaction*: Examining how ontological knowledge representation
can enhance robots' understanding of human behavior, intentions, and social contexts to enable more
natural, effective, and trustworthy human-robot collaboration.

**IMPORTANT DATES**

- Submission deadline: October 15th, 2025
- Notification: November 7th, 2025
- Camera ready version: November 28th, 2025

**LIST OF TOPICS (partial)**

Participants are invited to submit original extended abstract (2-4 pages + references) or papers (5-8 pages + references) on the topics of particular interest described above, but contributions are also welcome on topics such as:

- Foundational issues: 
	- Are there some ontological approaches better suited than others for autonomous robotics? why?
	- How should we ontologically model notions like capability, action, interaction, context etc. in robotics?
	- How can ontology be used to model culture, cultural knowledge and cultural behavior?
- Robustness: 
	- How can ontologies be used to help robots cope with the variety and relatively fluid structure of human environments?
- Ontologies in the perception-action loop: 
	- What roles can ontology play in autonomous manipulation?
	- How can ontology be used to support machine learning for object classification?
- Interactivity: 
	- How can knowledge about other agents present in the environment be modelled?
	- How can ontology be used to model the flow of an interaction, e.g., in the case of shared tasks?
- Normed behavior: 
	- How can we ontologically represent norms and cultural expectations?
	- How can expectations be acquired? would they be the same for robots and for humans?
- Explainability: 
	- Decision chains are very complex; how can these be organized and presented at various levels of detail for the benefit of a human user?
what is an explanation? what is a good explanation? how it be generated from a collection of knowledge items?
